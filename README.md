# Scan your code with SonarQube [![QA](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action/actions/workflows/qa.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action/actions/workflows/qa.yml)

This SonarSource project, available as a GitHub Action, scans your projects with SonarQube, and helps developers produce 
[Clean Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/clean-code/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=clean-code&utm_content=sonarqube-scan-action).

[SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) is a widely used static analysis solution for continuous code quality and security inspection. 
It helps developers identify and fix issues in their code that could lead to bugs, vulnerabilities, or decreased development velocity.
SonarQube supports the most popular programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Python, C, C++, and [many more](https://www.sonarsource.com/knowledge/languages/).

## Requirements

To run an analysis on your code, you first need to set up your project on SonarQube. Your SonarQube instance must be accessible from GitHub, and you will need an access token to run the analysis (more information below under **Environment variables**).

Read more information on how to analyze your code [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/github-integration/).

## Usage

Project metadata, including the location of the sources to be analyzed, must be declared in the file `sonar-project.properties` in the base directory:

```properties
sonar.projectKey=<replace with the key generated when setting up the project on SonarQube>

# relative paths to source directories. More details and properties are described
# at https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/project-administration/narrowing-the-focus/ 
sonar.sources=.
```

The workflow YAML file will usually look something like this:

```yaml
on:
  # Trigger analysis when pushing to your main branches, and when creating a pull request.
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
      - develop
      - 'releases/**'
  pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

name: Main Workflow
jobs:
  sonarqube:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        # Disabling shallow clones is recommended for improving the relevancy of reporting
        fetch-depth: 0
    - name: SonarQube Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@<action version> # Ex: v2.1.0, See the latest version at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
```

If your source code file names contain special characters that are not covered by the locale range of `en_US.UTF-8`, you can configure your desired locale like this:

```yaml
    - name: SonarQube Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@<action version> # Ex: v2.1.0, See the latest version at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
        LC_ALL: "ru_RU.UTF-8"
```

If your SonarQube server uses a self-signed certificate, you can pass a root certificate (in PEM format) to the Java certificate store:

```yaml
    - name: SonarQube Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@<action version> # Ex: v2.1.0, See the latest version at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
        SONAR_ROOT_CERT: ${{ secrets.SONAR_ROOT_CERT }}
```

You can change the analysis base directory by using the optional input `projectBaseDir` like this:

```yaml
- name: SonarQube Scan
  uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@<action version> # Ex: v2.1.0, See the latest version at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan
  with:
    projectBaseDir: app/src
```

In case you need to add additional analysis parameters, and you do not wish to set them in the `sonar-project.properties` file, you can use the `args` option:

```yaml
- name: SonarQube Scan
  uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@<action version> # Ex: v2.1.0, See the latest version at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/official-sonarqube-scan
  with:
    projectBaseDir: app/src
    args: >
      -Dsonar.python.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.xml
      -Dsonar.tests=tests/
      -Dsonar.verbose=true
```

More information about possible analysis parameters can be found in [the documentation](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/analysis-parameters.html).

### Environment variables

- `SONAR_TOKEN` – **Required** this is the token used to authenticate access to SonarQube. You can read more about security tokens [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/). You can set the `SONAR_TOKEN` environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository, or you can add them at the level of your GitHub organization (recommended).
- `SONAR_HOST_URL` – **Required** this tells the scanner where SonarQube is hosted. You can set the `SONAR_HOST_URL` environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository, or you can add them at the level of your GitHub organization (recommended).
- `SONAR_ROOT_CERT` – Holds an additional root certificate (in PEM format) that is used to validate the SonarQube server certificate. You can set the `SONAR_ROOT_CERT` environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository, or you can add them at the level of your GitHub organization (recommended).

## Alternatives for Java, .NET, and C/C++ projects

This GitHub Action will not work for all technologies. If you are in one of the following situations, you should use the following alternatives:

* Your code is built with Maven. Read the documentation about our [Scanner for Maven](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner-maven.html).
* Your code is built with Gradle. Read the documentation about our [Scanner for Gradle](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/gradle.html).
* You want to analyze a .NET solution. Read the documentation about our [Scanner for .NET](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner-msbuild.html).
* You want to analyze C/C++ code. Use the [SonarQube C and C++](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-github-c-cpp) GitHub Action.

## Error cleaning up workspace

In some cases, the checkout action may fail to clean up the workspace. This is a known problem for GitHub actions implemented as a docker container (such as `sonarqube-scan-action`) when self-hosted runners are used.
Example of the error message: `File was unable to be removed Error: EACCES: permission denied, unlink '/actions-runner/_work//project/.scannerwork/.sonar_lock'`
To work around the problem, `sonarqube-scan-action` attempts to fix the permission of the temporary files that it creates. If that doesn't work, you can manually clean up the workspace by running the following action:
```
- name: Clean the workspace
  uses: docker://alpine
  with:
    args: /bin/sh -c "find \"${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}\" -mindepth 1 ! -name . -prune -exec rm -rf {} +"
```
You can find more info [here](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/434).
